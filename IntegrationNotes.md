# Notes

- Node server is running
- Create "user" automatically from Pulse
- How to log in automatically?
- Whitelabel "Import from Calendly/etc."
- Whitelabel "Connect your calendar"

## Tenancy
- Is each tenant a Cal user?
- Can we have more than one user per tenant? What do we call those?



### Laravel-side needs
- Connect to DB, postgres so thats cool
- Create accounts
- Log into Cal
- Define a slug/prefix for calendars
